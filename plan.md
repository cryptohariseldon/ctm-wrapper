# Transition Plan: Mock to Real Transactions on Localnet

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to transition the Continuum CP-Swap system from mock transactions to real transactions on a Solana localnet. The transition will be executed in phases, with specific testing goals at each major step to ensure system integrity and functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### Mock Transaction System
- **Order Submission**: FIFO queue increments sequence, emits events, no actual token transfers
- **Order Execution**: 2-second simulated delay, 98% fixed output ratio, mock signatures
- **Relayer Service**: In-memory order tracking, no blockchain interaction
- **Client Integration**: Partial signing supported but not utilized for real transactions

### Limitations
- No persistent state (orders lost on restart)
- No real DEX integration
- Fixed pricing model
- No slippage protection enforcement
- No fee collection mechanism

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅

### 1.1 Local Solana Test Validator Setup ✅

**Tasks:**
- Install and configure Solana test validator
- Deploy CP-Swap program to localnet
- Deploy Continuum program
- Configure RPC endpoints
- Set up program log monitoring

**Status:** COMPLETED
- Validator running at http://localhost:8899
- CP-Swap deployed at: GkenxCtvEabZrwFf15D3E6LjoZTywH2afNwiqDwthyDp
- Continuum deployed at: 9tcAhE4XGcZZTE8ez1EW8FF7rxyBN8uat2kkepgaeyEa

**Testing Goals:**
- ✅ Validator runs stable for 10+ minutes
- ✅ Both programs deploy successfully
- ✅ Can query program accounts via RPC
- ✅ Program logs are accessible
- ✅ Transaction simulation works

### 1.2 Real Token Creation ✅

**Tasks:**
- Create USDC-like token (6 decimals)
- Create WSOL-like token (9 decimals)
- Mint initial supply (1M each)
- Create token accounts for test wallets
- Set up token metadata

**Status:** COMPLETED
- USDC mint: 914qoamoCDj7W3cN6192LPhfE3UMo3WVg5nqURb1LAPw
- WSOL mint: 4PV5koSWtfu9C1keSMNNMooK14PQynNBz1YNPpSsJLJa
- Initial supply minted and distributed

**Testing Goals:**
- ✅ Tokens created with correct decimals
- ✅ Initial supply minted successfully
- ✅ Can transfer tokens between accounts
- ✅ Token balances queryable via RPC
- ✅ Associated token accounts created

### 1.3 CP-Swap Pool Deployment ✅

**Tasks:**
- Initialize CP-Swap AMM configuration
- Create USDC/WSOL pool
- Add initial liquidity (10K USDC, 100 WSOL)
- Register pool with Continuum authority
- Verify pool functionality

**Status:** COMPLETED
- Pool ID: F7wLNYJrsnxAC23tomtxLBCUEBaaovK3pRxwe4qektdb
- AMM Config: EPyDg2LEJDdq3QKR1am2rawQtkBXbE4HFsWSMFvLwiHa (index 4)
- Pool authority: GhUACgDVGkgPWoVNbEWZELsb5scyjqY2cwHKs7CttRXD (Continuum's cp_pool_authority PDA)
- Initial liquidity: 10,000 WSOL + 10,000 USDC

**Key Findings:**
1. Custom Authority Issue Resolved:
   - CP-Swap was checking if payer == custom_authority for pools with custom authority
   - This prevented PDAs from being custom authorities (they can't be signers)
   - Removed this check from swap_base_input.rs and swap_base_output.rs
   - Redeployed CP-Swap program with the fix

2. Pool Initialization Fix:
   - Initial attempts only created 3-byte accounts
   - Used Raydium client libraries for proper initialization
   - AMM configs now have full 236 bytes with correct data

3. Account Ordering Fix:
   - CP-Swap expects user (payer) as first account for token transfers
   - Updated Continuum wrapper to pass accounts in correct order
   - User account must be marked as signer in remaining accounts

**Testing Goals:**
- ✅ Pool exists with correct parameters
- ✅ AMM config exists (index 4, 236 bytes)  
- ✅ CPI mechanism verified
- ✅ Direct swaps blocked - "Invalid authority" error confirms custom authority works
- ✅ Pool has 10,000 WSOL and 10,000 USDC liquidity
- ✅ Execute successful swap through Continuum
- ✅ Verify token movements

**Successful Swap Test:**
- User swapped 100 USDC for ~98.76 WSOL through Continuum wrapper
- Transaction: 5xawY3mLG848nH7gUJmdN4A22wHeGqFA8WLYSGadCTUKfQ38Lbqqcc2hfReUEeeWHg5Zb5Vunt3YLKgTbvbzH5gK
- User USDC: 960000 → 959900 (spent 100)
- User WSOL: 70000 → 70098.764820911 (received 98.76)
- Pool USDC: 10000 → 10100
- Pool WSOL: 10000 → 9901.235179089
